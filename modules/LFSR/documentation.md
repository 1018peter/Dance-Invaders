## Linear-Feedback Shift Register
---
A 16-bit [Fibonacci LFSR](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/LFSR-F16.svg/1920px-LFSR-F16.svg.png) referenced from Wikipedia. 
Serves as a general purpose PRNG. Can be seeded with a preset initial seed or a dynamic one through the seed port. Note that the seed cannot be zero.

* Inputs
  * `clk`: The clock that controls the speed at which the LFSR cycles through its states.
  * `rst`: Asynchronous reset. The seed is loaded upon each reset.
  * `seed`: 16-bit bus. The seed of the PRNG - the initial state after resetting.
* Outputs
  * `rand_out`: 16-bit bus. The random number generated by the PRNG.
